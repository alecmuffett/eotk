## Introduction

EOTK provides a tool for deploying HTTP and HTTPS onion sites to
provide official onion-networking presences for popular websites.

The result is essentially a "man in the middle" proxy; you should set
them up only for your own sites, or for sites which do not require
login credentials of any kind.

## Installation

Please refer to the [How To Install](docs.d/HOW-TO-INSTALL.md) guide,
and the other documents in [that folder](docs.d/).

## What's Changed?

Please refer to the [Changelog](docs.d/CHANGELOG.md).

## Help I'm Stuck!

## Important Note About Anonymity

The presumed use-case of EOTK is that you have an already-public
website and you wish to give it a corresponding Onion address.

A lot of people mistakenly believe that Tor Onion Networking is "all
about anonymity" - which is incorrect, since it also includes:

* extra privacy
* identity/surety of to whom you are connected
* freedom from oversight/network surveillance
* anti-blocking, and...
* enhanced integrity/tamperproofing

...none of which are the same as "anonymity", but all of which are
valuable qualities to add to communications.

Further: setting up an Onion address can provide less contention, more
speed & more bandwidth to people accessing your site than they would
get by using Tor "Exit Nodes".

If you set up EOTK in its intended mode then your resulting site is
almost certainly not going to be anonymous; for one thing your brand
name (etc) will likely be plastered all over it.

If you want to set up a server which includes anonymity **as well as**
all of the aforementioned qualities, you [want to be reading an
entirely different document,

## Acknowledgements

EOTK stands largely on the experience of work I led at Facebook to
create `www.facebookcorewwwi.onion`, but it owes a *huge* debt to
[Mike Tigas](https://github.com/mtigas)'s work at ProPublica to put
their site into Onionspace through using NGINX as a rewriting proxy --
and that [he wrote the whole experience up in great
detail](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/a-more-secure-and-anonymous-propublica-using-tor-hidden-services)
including [sample config
files](https://gist.github.com/mtigas/9a7425dfdacda15790b2).

Reading this prodded me to learn about NGINX and then aim to shrink &
genericise the solution; so thanks, Mike!

Also, thanks go to Christopher Weatherhead for acting as a local NGINX
*sounding board* :-)

And back in history: Michal Nánási, Matt Jones, Trevor Pottinger and
the rest of the FB-over-Tor team.  Hugs.
